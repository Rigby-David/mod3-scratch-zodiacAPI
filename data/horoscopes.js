    'horoscope': 'The Cancer moon aligns with Venus in the sector of your chart that governs wellness this morning, dear Aquarius, encouraging you to kick off the day with healthy habits. Be sure to hydrate, eat well, and get some stretching in, and the universe will smile on you as the hours continue to pass. Unfortunately, a hard square between Mercury and Mars could cause you to feel more emotional than usual, especially if your love life has been a bit rocky as of late. Try not to hang your happiness on someone else right now, and don\'t feel guilty if you need to take some time out for yourself.'

    'horoscope': 'Take a moment to invest in your confidence this morning, dear Pisces, as the Cancer moon cozies up to sweet Venus in your solar fifth house. Meditation, positive mantras, and even a sassy outfit can help you make the most of these supportive vibes, giving you an opportunity to start the day on a happier note. Try to hold your tongue if you feel like imparting unsolicited advice right now, as a harsh square between Mercury and Mars will have people on edge. Artistic breakthroughs and divine inspiration may find you later tonight, thanks to a sweet connection between Luna and Uranus.'
